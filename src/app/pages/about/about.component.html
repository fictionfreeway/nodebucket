    nodeBucket is a task management app designed to help individuals and teams stay organized and on track. We believe that everyone has the ability to achieve their goals and accomplish great things, but sometimes it can be hard to stay focused and prioritize tasks in today's busy world. That's where NodeBucket comes in.
    <br><br>
    Our app allows users to create and manage to-do lists, set reminders, and track progress on projects. With nodeBucket, you can break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, and track your progress along the way. We also offer collaboration features, so you can work with team members and share updates in real-time.
    <br><br>
    At nodeBucket, we are passionate about helping people achieve their goals and improve their productivity. That's why we have made it our mission to create the best task management app on the market. We are constantly updating and improving our app, and we value the feedback of our users.
    Nodebucket is and will remain a totally free web application with no ads or paid promotions. We have tried many other task management apps that have all fallen short due to the developerâ€™s attempts at monetizing what is otherwise a very simple app.
